# Udacity.AndroidStudio.Kotlin
A mobile repository for school mobile course.

For the detail, it is my jouney in **Udacity's Kotlin Course** and of course, that course's free.
Here is the link of the course if you interest: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud9012

I also make some notes about everything in the course, but remember, it's just the notes.
I maked it so shortly, I taked down what i thought is important, and some I got on the Kotlin document site.
You can take a look, and download it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19wrbesPPkXLwqrV5gK7uPXbq8HO6lGvJIVJ5IkzfODM/edit?usp=sharing) (google docs file link).



### What is inside this repository?
Just the code based on the example projects in the course and its Intro.
My Android Studio's version is **4.1**, so it's a little different from the code of the course (their Android Studio version is 3.+) 


### Where is the code?
Hmm... It's a liitle inconvenience for you and it's my bad too. My code in the branch **master**, so you know what to do :)))
